There are no direct commercial flights between Little Rock, Arkansas, and Russellville, Arkansas. Russellville does not have a commercial airport, and the nearest major airport is in Little Rock (Clinton National Airport, LIT). The two cities are about 7880 miles apart by road, and the most practical way to travel between them is by car, which typically costs $14$21 in fuel and takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes.

While some travel sites list flights &quot;to Russellville,&quot; these refer to flights to nearby airports such as Hot Springs Memorial Field (HOT) or Little Rock (LIT), not to Russellville itself. There are no scheduled commercial flights for this short route, and chartering a private plane would be significantly more expensive than driving.

Summary Table&#58; Little Rock to Russellville Travel Options

Mode	Estimated Cost	Duration	Notes
Car (drive)	$14$21	1h 15m	Most practical and direct
Commercial Air	Not available	N/A	No direct flights; nearest airport is LIT
Private Charter	$$$$$	~2030 min (air)	Not cost-effective for this short distance
Conclusion&#58;
There is no commercial air service between Little Rock and Russellville. Driving is the fastest and most economical option, costing about $14$21 for the trip.
